# C++ Algorithms and Data structures

This repository contains C++ based examples of many
popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README
with small related explanation and links for further reading/watching.

*☝ Note that this project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes
only, and it is **not** meant to be used for production.*

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

## How to use this repository

*This project doesn't use any advanced or third parties libraries, only STL.*
*This project use C++20 standard.*

You should only have installed and configured compiler + debugger environment([mingw64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) for example). Then you just need to compile and run `main.cpp` file to execute test-benchmark for specific data-structure/algorithm.
