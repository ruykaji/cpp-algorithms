# Liked List

A linked list is a common data structure used in computer science to store and manage collections of data. It consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference or link to the next node in the sequence. The linked list does not necessarily occupy a contiguous block of memory like an array does.

The basic building block of a linked list is the node. Each node contains two main components: the data or value to be stored and a pointer or reference to the next node in the list. The last node in the list typically has a null reference to indicate the end of the list.
