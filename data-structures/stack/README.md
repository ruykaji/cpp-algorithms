In computer science, a stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates; you can only add or remove plates from the top of the stack.

A stack has two primary operations:

- push: This operation is used to add an element to the top of the stack.
- pop: This operation is used to remove the element from the top of the stack.

Additionally, there is often a third operation:

- peek (or Top): This operation retrieves the element from the top of the stack without removing it.

These operations are analogous to pushing a new plate onto the stack, popping a plate from the top of the stack, and peeking at the top plate without removing it from the stack.
